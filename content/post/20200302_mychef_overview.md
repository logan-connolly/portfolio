# Goal of MyChef

The goal of this project is to help me decide what to make for dinner based on what I have in the kitchen. This is also an excellent opportunity to develop my software engineering skills, in particular how to develop microservices and bring them together into one application.

Following this post, there will be series of articles that detail how to bring this application to life: 

* Setting up services in Docker
* Designing the API 
* Building a Web Scraper
* Using NLP to classify Ingredients
* Develop Front-End

# Tools

The main tools that I will be using throughout this series of posts are:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): for containerization of microservices
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): a python api framework
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): database for storing information
* [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/): a python library for scraping recipes from websites
* [Spacy](https://spacy.io/): a python library for natural language processing (nlp)
