### Hi there

My name is Logan and I'm the author of this site. I made the website to introduce myself to those who do not know me and to showcase some of my work. The source code for the projects can be found on my [{{< fa fab github >}}](https://github.com/logan-connolly) 

### Quick facts

- self-taught programmer
- from the USA, but living in Germany since 2016
- work as Data Science Consultant at Capgemini since 2018
- enjoy playing Catan, reading Dostoevsky, listening to Skegss, tuning into *Fest und Flauschig*, among other things

### Why the website?

The online learning community has helped me so much on my journey towards learning programming and data science. So I thought it would be good to give back. Feel free to get in-touch with me on [{{< fa fab linkedin >}}]((https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganconnolly/))
